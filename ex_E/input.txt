Here is a summary about Omar Khayyam.
Omar Khayyam (from 1048 to 1131) was a Persian polymath renowned for his contributions to mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, and poetry. Born in Nishapur, in present-day Iran, Khayyam is best known in the Western world for his collection of quatrains, the “Rubaiyat,” translated and popularized by Edward FitzGerald in the 19th century.

Contributions:

Mathematics:
Khayyam made significant advancements in algebra and geometry. His work on solving cubic equations and his classification of equations were highly influential. He wrote “Treatise on Demonstration of Problems of Algebra,” where he provided geometric solutions to cubic equations.

Astronomy:
As an astronomer, Khayyam contributed to the reform of the Persian calendar. He was part of a group that designed the Jalali calendar, which was more accurate than the Gregorian calendar used today.

Philosophy:
In philosophy, Khayyam’s works reflected his critical and questioning nature. His philosophical outlook was deeply skeptical and existential, often pondering the meaning of life and the nature of existence.

Poetry:
Khayyam’s poetry, particularly the “Rubaiyat-Khayyam” is characterized by its contemplative and sometimes hedonistic themes. His quatrains often delve into topics like the fleeting nature of life, the pursuit of happiness, and the questioning of religious orthodoxy.

Legacy:

Khayyam’s legacy endures through his mathematical and scientific achievements, but it is his poetry that has captivated readers worldwide. The “Rubaiyat,” especially through FitzGerald’s translations, has inspired numerous interpretations and adaptations in literature, art, and music. Despite facing criticism from some contemporaries for his unorthodox views, Khayyam’s work remains a testament to his intellectual versatility and profound insight into the human condition. 

And, here is a couples pieces of his poetry, from Rubaiyat-Khayyam

Wake! For the Sun who scattered into flight
The Stars before him from the Field of Night,
Drives Night along with them from Heav’n, and strikes
The Sultan’s Turret with a Shaft of Light.

Before the phantom of False morning died,
Methought a Voice within the Tavern cried,
“When all the Temple is prepared within,
Why nods the drowsy Worshipper outside?”

And, as the Cock crew, those who stood before
The Tavern shouted—“Open then the Door!
You know how little while we have to stay,
And, once departed, may return no more.”
